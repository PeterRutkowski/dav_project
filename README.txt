In the project we have explored the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. In particular we have created a poster (with 12 plots embedded) and a presentation
(19 interactive plots and 1 GIF). When creating plots we have used the seaborn library for static plots (apart from maps, which were made with geopandas) and the plotly library
for interactive plots.
The data came from: Kaggle, Our World in Data, Applea, Bundesamt fur Gesundheit, SRG SSR. In some of the plots we have created the data manually based on the information
in the research papers (the PDF-s are included in the data folder). The details:
